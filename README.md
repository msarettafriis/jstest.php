# jstest.php

A test to see if I can execute Javascript from within PHP

## License

It's released under [the Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) because this is a silly test that probably can't be copyrighted anyways (though I'm not a lawyer).

## Why?

This is my idea of fun. No real practical purpose other than use some javascript I haven't used in a while as well as learn some PHP.

There could be practical applications, but that's for people much smarter than me. Those people probably already know that this is possible, however.

## How do I test it for myself?

Put the jstest.php file inside a folder of a PHP-enabled server. If you're on Windows or macOS, use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). If you're on some other \*nix-based OS, then just set up your LAMP/LEMP/FAMP/FEMP/whatever stack. Then go to http://127.0.0.1/jstest.php if you put it in the root of that server.
